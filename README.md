#### Project Title  
BikeShare Data Exploration

#### Description  
This project analyzes bikeshare usage patterns in Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC. Using Python, it cleans the raw CSVs, computes key statistics (trip durations, popular stations, user demographics), and provides an interactive command-line interface for users to filter by city, month, and day of week.

#### File Structure  
- **bikeshare.py** – main script to load data, compute statistics, and interact with the user  
- **bikeshare_2.py** – refactored version with modular functions and improved error handling  
- **chicago_test.py** – unit tests for data-loading and statistic functions  
- **data/** – directory containing raw CSV files (ignored by Git)  
- **README.md** – this documentation
